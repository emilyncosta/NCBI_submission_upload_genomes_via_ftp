# Explanation 



1. Create a directory using FTP, once you've logged in and you have your own address like `emilyncosta_gmail.com_xxxxx` and create a directory where you'll upload submission `africanum`

```
ftp.cwd("uploads/lizaspinasse_gmail.com_ojGYyyaI")
ftp.mkd("africanum")

```

2. Change the location of the directory 

```
ftp.cwd("uploads/lizaspinasse_gmail.com_ojGYyyaI/WGSMTB")
```

With you information it could be like 

```
ftp.cwd("uploads/emilyncosta_gmail.com_xxxx/africanum")

```


3. The next code is uploading the file one by one 

```python


for a_file in genome_list:
    print("\n@@@@\n\n=> ", a_file,"\n\n@@@")
    with open(a_file ,'rb') as f:
        ftp.storbinary('STOR %s' % f.name , f)


```

4. As a confirmation, after everything is uploaded we confirm from the server 

```

print("\n\n###\n\nList of all Genomes uploaded via FTP:\n\n ")

for f in ftp.nlst():
    print(f)

```

5. We close the FTP connection

```
ftp.quit()

```

8. Now we close the python program

```
print("\n\n$$$\n\nDONE\n\n$$$")
```
